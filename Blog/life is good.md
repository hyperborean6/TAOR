# Life is good.

There are no bad outcomes, only bad actions.

I would like to make a point that we live in a shared reality. That our fuzzy understanding can exist within useful ontological structures such as spritiuality or science. That we did not set this existence into motion but are here observing. Though interactions we can affect outcomes.

Secondly, that both good and bad outcomes are dervied from the same source which is this shared reality. The same rules of our shared reality that keep our car running if we maintain it will also cause it break down if we don’t perform maintenance.

I believe when we expereince outcomes we are really experiencing ourselves. Of course by ourselves I also mean our community as well. I think people recognize this when small things happen like locking yourself out of your house, or hitting a new PR in the gym. But not when big things happen like housing prices and pay rates adjusting the material standard of living downwards.

This could lead someone to say some outcome is bad instead of some action. But I would counter that all outcomes are good. Rather its better to understand that only when your desire for outcome exceeds your capability to understand why an outcome needs to occur do outcomes appear bad.

### Apply this viewpoint when its difficult

The problem I think most people will encounter is applying this framework to people being mass murdered. It a difficult problem for two reasons;

1. Unlike a car breaking down due to poor maintenance the cost in human suffering seems really high.
2. Because there are few if any communities that have internalized and accepted this viewpoint its hard to arrive at for most people who outsource significant portions of their thinking

Think about it this way though. The careful wisdom and science of designing the first car must be rejected for the driver to be left on the side of the road. Further, when small problems occur people want to eliminate the outcome instead of the action that caused it. The outcome was really a small warning. However by supressing it they begin adding bad action onto bad action. This leads to social intervention psychology like housing or healthcare are human rights. As bad actions accumulate they eventually lead to tipping points where the supressed outcomes come flooding back into reality like the breaking of the damn. 

Take this example where a driving license required you to pass a calculus test. Instead of “solving the outcome” of people not having cars we require the right action of people being smart enough to build them. Would the number of drivers on the road go up or down? How would the intelligence of the people in that community trying to meet this requirment change? Would large corporations function the same? Would we be impacting the envirment the same? What would be the genetic impact generationally? Instead of answering that question the masses will say something about “mass transit” or “human rights”. Taking wrong action that will compound until major social and enviromental distasters occur.

Now let me ask you the most important question. In contemporary politics the united states as a nation is dissolving but nobody ever asks themselves if they deserve a nation? If you deserve one then you should be able to build one. If you could have built one then you wouldn’t have lost the one you have in the first place.

When I wrote the book of Taor I wrote the instruction manual for building that community. You can act on whats there and reliably pass it on generation after generation and the machine will function. This is counter to the current culture of  tearing down the existing machine at the cost of future results to get todays outcome. Bigger risks might even loom if AI suddenly starts producing outcomes at an accelerated pace. People could become detached, dependant and helpless. Relying more and more on social interactions to acquire resources. 

Im not suggesting a full malthusian thought process. But mitigating risk might be rather simple whether its a stalled car of mass social conflict. Segregate communities with different action goals and let each suffer their own consequences. Give people right action solutions and enforce them within your community. Focus on suffering that leads to consciousness development by averting unexpected disasters, internal to community or external,  but allows painful events that a community is close to overcoming to happen.
