# Don’t destroy obstacles avoid them

Why is the debate format so popular in the political space? Because it radicalizes people against each other. Alternatively conversation when people are in the process of learning and trying to change can be very rewarding.

A big portion of social disagreement is ego (or salary in business). Rightfully so as this is part of the human legacy. Those who are “correct” gain social status by proving their correctness and gaining the trust of others. 

However I ask here, can we argue our way forward? Or is it simply better to bypass obstacles?

To build the communities of the future we should be asking the following questions when different viewpoint collide.

### **Are we working toward the same goal?**

 This is huge. Take for example how Americans have internalized the globalist narrative of destroying local communities by “diversifying” them. Alternatively, the external communities act in self interest. Although both their goals slightly overlap in certain situations neither group has a clear vision of the future.

**Solution:** I write about creating a shared goal as a critical component in TAOR. I also talk about intellectualizing decisions beyond reaction and emotion. 

### **What would it take to change peoples opinion?**

**Solution:** Just ask. By simply asking they will often tell you what would change their mind and you will be able to clearly see motives and logic from their perspective.

### **Should we be advancing someone else’s knowledge or advancing our own?**

When we learn something we often want to share it, and thats a good thing. But beyond presenting the information how invested can we be in pressing that persons change?

**Solutiuon:** Become a person people value and the information you present will be more readily accepted. That requires more work because your focusing on your ownt growth path. The more we change ourselves the more the world changes around us. 

### If there was no ego and shared destiny would we have this debate?

If your in an ego battles then there really is no point. If you depend on them then its a shared stupidity because you are in this game together.

**Solution:** Although an embattled opponent will eventually abandon bad arguments its often much easier to walk away. Build a relationship and ask questions. If you love and support people and offer advice from that psychology then they are much more likely to accept it. You are your community. If someone in your community is dumb then you are dumb. If you have the knowledge and can’t pass it on then you are failing in your thought leadership position.

### Is it personally advantages to get ahead at the cost of the community?

This is huge and very evident in the corporate world where companies have stagnant managment structures that eventually crumble becuase self interested participants fight for control of decisions and more pay. Or at a national level by polluting the enviroment for short term profits. Only to destroy everything around them for future generations.

**Solution:** It important to out compete members of your comunity  or other communities who are making short sighted decisions. But remember why your doing it.

I think the main takeaway here is knowing when and how to engage with our community and how we can bypass conflict. Conflict is inefficient. Compete when you have to but destroy your oppents based on community justice that guides your community to a coherent successful outcome.
