# The Meta

*Meta-Cognition - Two mirros facing each other*

*Meta-Consciousness - Team consciousness*

*Meta-Patterns - The bridge between math and real life*

Metacognition is the process of thinking about how thought occurs—within ourselves, in others, or in consciousness more broadly. For metacognition to have real impact, I believe it must first overcome the reactive nature of consciousness by allowing intellectualized conclusions to take precedence.

Second, effective metacognition requires a broad enough scope to recognize complex causal relationships—such as how experiences we have never lived through might shape another person's actions today.

Third, success depends on the recursiveness of consciousness. Can it observe others metacognitively? Can it observe itself? Can it recognize others observing itself? This recursion leads to an infinite regress—like mirrors reflecting into one another, but within consciousness itself.

Lastly, sensitivity or crystallized knowledge enables interpretation of subtle cues from sensory input, forming meaningful observations.

I suspect that these dimensions—intellectual override, scope, recursion, and sensitivity—are influenced by factors like outcome dependence, available resources, and obstacles. If a person desires change, they will likely adjust each of these dimensions to achieve it. Ultimately, the pursuit of expanded consciousness may become a goal in itself.

Meta-Consciousnes is the recognition of conscisness happening outside our perceptable consciousness scale. This could be possible from the combination of unperceivable conscioussness units like brain cells combining to form us. It could also be a large group of people combining to form a meta consciousness. It could be some unknown quantity of an unkown value.

Understanding this process is critical for the conscious person. To what degree does each of the smaller units composing the greater consciousness lean toward its own internal state or the external reactions of the group? Take communities of people for example. Is the community composed of people with a strong internal monolouge who form conclusions through inductive reasoning? Or is the communty full of memorizers who simply absorb information without much reflection?

Also, for a thought experiment, imagine a person who has no intentionality within their philosphy and spirituality. Whos lack of purpose has devolved into hedonism. Now imagine a whole community who shares these characteristics. The outcomes would be similiar on a personal level and on a community level. 

Every thought we have ripples outward affecting everything everywhere all the time. The lack of thought has the same consequences. Can the action of zoning out to lights on a screen be justified? Will our community succeed if the mass of consciousness is turned off, or worse being fed glowing lights from some external community competitive to ours? Maybe with each passing day the lights show your community surrendering, being displaced or participating in self destructive behaviour.

Lastly I want to think about meta patterns. A simple meta patterns would be the concept of counting. You could count the number of coins to reach an economic value, the number of apples to equala weight or the number of people who gree with you to reach some solcial consensus. But what about a concept like breaking something down into smaller parts to rebuild it. This could be composting food scraps to grow next years vegetables. This could also be deconstructing psychology to rebuild it in a different way. These meta patterns pervade even common speech with analogies like comparing a  tpoic to the building of a house and pointing out how important a good foundation can be. Some people might think about this breifly and push back saying something simple like integration could describe breaking things down into smaller parts. But those tools lack the reflexive use of people who are epxerts in them even in situations where they could easily apply. Creating a topolgy and simplyfying it for everyday use would be a huge win advancing peoples thinking patterns and growing the consciousness.
