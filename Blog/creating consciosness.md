# Creating a Meta Consciousness

### Introduction

A group of people can’t be forged from sheer will of desire. But must be harnessed as all energy flowing through natural systems. A meta consciousness is a community but more than a community its a community of people in acklowedgement of the truth and shared goals

### Shared Reality - Creationing the Nucleus

This is a very difficult task that may or may not be a one person responsibility. But basically we need a reason for CAPABLE people to come together and have the foresight to understand they are developing the origin story. This could be as simple as a group of people finding themselves in shared circumstances and forming a team. It could also be existing social cohesion from bloodline or cultural unit that already exists. It may require the ability to draw people in from afar. When these people come together there needs to be some emotional or social cycles where people are sharing in celebration or struggle and recognizing that this group exists in recognition of the people in it. Not some simpler mundane reasoning like making extra money for luxury goods.

### Shared Goals - Why bother thinking as a group

The creation story is common. We will live through this several times in our life. But jumping from a friend or family group into a functional team of people is a big step. If your group has significant emotional strife this could be very easy and reactionary. If your community is comfortable then this will need to be intellectualized and will prove more difficult. Let me restate that in simplistic terms. If you are in a terrible place people will rally around almost any change, but if your in a good place people will want to be very particular about where your going. Shared vision is the core component required to exit this stage. The more nuanced the vision the more nuanced the team will need to be.

### Consensus - Begin Thinking as Group

There might be a cycle of events here very similiar to a how a single person conciousness thinks.

1. Information intake - Collect, share and debate
2. Define small iterative goals the group can accomplish
3. Break those goals into sprints and tasks
4. Reflect, rethink and restart cycle

### Group Tools

One of the most obvious is control of the group. Expanding or contractingthe size and giving people the responsibilities they can handle. Creating easily digestible social standards and beliefs for people to integrate with and then supporting or shaming members based on their cooperation with those standards.

Outside the group extending the zone of control is a major opportunity. In current society there is probably a desire to stay hidden or appear undesirable to the masses so as not to attract low quality cancer intrusion. However forcing interactions with outsiders to meet certain standards can establish control. There is also the opportunity to influence and enter external groups. These could materialize in products standards where products should be certified by group authority forcing revenue for the group. Entering media or political groups to gain influence. Lawfare or culturefare groups that attack through non voilent means. Interfering with external groups creation by diverting their resources away from them. Preventing technology diffusion. Creating thought tools like “spiritual barrier” to define a strategy the group can rally around.

### Obstacles

Creating an intentional community by giving allowing people a point to rally around.

Training people to serve the group rather than unleashing their ego on it

Inneficiancy and incompetance

Drawing attention or scrutiny or allowing bad actors to divest social equity in any way

Presenting a target for external groups to attack
