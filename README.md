# What this is
I am writing this book as the first community contribution based ontology. I have collected the thoughts, views, opinions, sentiments, history and plans of the people in my lives through detailed questioning. Then have pain-stakingly transcribed the usable, overlapping and non-contradicting portions into this book. As a result this has produced a generic broad consensus of the sources used. Each page is written as if a singular writer is writing to a very dear loved one so that the intimacy, care and urgency of this dialouge is not lost. But I believe that there are truely many people who hold this perpective.

# Why
Right now, at large, the social cohesion of communities is being dissolved. The visible patterns emergent as a result of this are people "reacting" to each new crisis with a total lack of teamwork or foresight. But creating a shared vision and community conscioussness could change that. Im not trying to "re-assemble the pieces of the old system". Im describing something new. By building a strong identitity, then planning for shared goals it becomes much easier to accomplish difficult things.
